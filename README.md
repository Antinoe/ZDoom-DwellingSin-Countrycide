This is a compatibility patch for Dwelling Sin that allows it to work with Trenchworks' Countrycide.

# Features:
### -Conversion of Countrycide's items and weapons to a Sin-compatible format.
### -Shift+Click to swing your Shortsword. There's also an item variant of it, but it does the same thing, making it act as clutter. I'll fix this in the next update.
### -Recipes for combining the food you find throughout the map.

# Requirements:
### Dwelling Sin: https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=77681
### Countrycide: https://www.moddb.com/mods/trench-foot-wip/downloads/countrycide
