This is a compatibility patch for Dwelling Sin that allows it to work with Trenchworks' Countrycide.

Includes:
-Conversion of Countrycide's items and weapons to a Sin-compatible format.
-Shift+Click to swing your Shortsword. There's also an item variant of it, but it does the same thing. I'll fix this in the next update.
-Recipes for combining the food you find throughout the map.

Issues:
-When a Shotgun-dropping enemy dies, it drops Sin's Buckshot Shells, not the Patch's replacement. I currently don't know how to solve this. I'll need to study Sin's ZScript functions more.
-There lacks Face Sprites for the Master Templar. Due to this, Doomguy's face shows in the Inventory.
-There are no weapon effects (smoke, flares, sparks) as seen in vanilla Countrycide's arsenal.
-Since the Revolver now uses the FIRE_MANUAL SinFireType, casings eject out of the weapon when fired.
